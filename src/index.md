Sardinian guy relocated in Pisa for study, I’ve been addicted to the monitor and keyboard since I got my first PC at the age of 10. When I discovered what you can do with some keystrokes and a few lines of code, well, it was love at first sight, or... at first ”Hello, world!”. I love all things web related and I’m pretty sure I could never live without an internet connection - especially on my phone - so this is why I combined my two passions and I’m now a React JS enthusiat, endlessly clashing against ninja ’;’ and criminal indentation
