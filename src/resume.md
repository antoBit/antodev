I am a full-stack senior software engineer with seven years of experience in web development.

I started working with React JS since `this.setState()` was a thing and I followed it until the new era of stateless functional components and all the cool new things (is React still cool‚Ä¶? ü§î).

My main area is the front-end, but I also like to work on backend services and I love implementing a CLI script to do all sorts of things üíª 

I am very good at prototyping my ideas and taking them from a Slack thread to something to build on top of. 

My ideal workplace is a small team where ideas bounce off one other and are quickly translated into code, but also where we take our time optimizing the tools that make the developers‚Äô lives better.

A typical Slack convo with me is lots of GIFs, unrequested suggestions on musicals, movies and TV series, and cat pictures üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
