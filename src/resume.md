## About me

I am a senior software engineer with 7 years of experience in web development. I started working with React JS since `this.setState()` was a thing and I followed it until the new era of stateless functional components, hooks, Redux, the Context API and all the cool new things (is React still cool...? ü§î).
I also explored the woods of backend development with Node JS (modules and NPM packages) and Express/Hapi, mainly in the AWS ecosystem, but I also worked with the Google Cloud environment.

I also have a good eye for design and interfaces, I love accessibility and I'm always trying to improve on it üíÖüèª

In my last job as a Senior Developer I was onboarded exclusively remotely and I quickly thrived onwing all parts of the product. I am very good at thinking on my feet and at technical decision-making and I excel at quickly prototyping my ideas to further explore paths to take to tackle a techincal task.
I mentored and helped a junior developer grow and learn the ropes of new technologies helping her become a senior developer.

What excites me the most is learning a new technology/framework/library and building something amazing with it üöÄ

Having been working remotely for the last three years, I'm confident in sharing progress on my work with the entire team, asking for feedback and brainstorming session in order to get everyone's opinion on what I'm doing. I'm pretty good at receiving constructive criticism and I follow a positive attitude towards work and my colleague's code: if it works and it's good code, I _really_ couldn't care less what you name a variable or if you've used camel case vs. kebab case (don't come at me if you use VIM, I will never use it.)
