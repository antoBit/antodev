I recently came across this bug at work and it took me a minute to figure it out.
What I had was something like this:

```javascript
<div
    className="image-container"
    style={% raw %}{{{% endraw %}
        position: 'absolute',
        top: `${top}%`,
        left: `${left}%`,
        width: `${width}%`,
        height: `${height}%`,
        background: `transparent url(${image_url}) no-repeat center center`,
        backgroundSize: 'contain'
   {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}
/>
```

After inspecting the output HTML and a bit of googling, I came across this <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5030" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="closed issue on React's Github">closed issue on React's Github</a>.

Apparently, using the CSS `background` shorthand property with a `backgroundSize` prop causes this last property to be cleared **if and when** the `background` property is updated.

A quick and easy fix is to explicitly set every property by expanding the shorthand property:

```javascript
<div
    className="image-container"
    style={% raw %}{{{% endraw %}
        position: 'absolute',
        top: `${top}%`,
        left: `${left}%`,
        width: `${width}%`,
        height: `${height}%`,
        backgroundColor: 'transparent',
        backgroundImage: `url(${image_url})`,
        backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat',
        backgroundPosition: 'center center',
        backgroundSize: 'contain'
   {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}
/>
```

That's all! Hope this is useful to you üí™üèª
