Have you ever found yourself wanting to show your work to a client, but didnâ€™t want to setup a server only for that reason? Or maybe you wanted to use the APIs of a particular service, but they didnâ€™t allow /localhost/ as a valid IP address in their access whitelist?

If the answer is yes, then this post is for you.

## Ngrok to the rescue!

From ngrokâ€™s [official website](https://ngrok.com) :

> ngrok is a simplified API-first ingress-as-a-service that adds connectivity, security, and observability to your apps with no code changes.

What!? Letâ€™s translate this: ngrok is an application that creates a tunnel between your computer and the internet, solving a couple of the most commons hiccups when developing web applications:

1. Show someone else your work in progress without having to deploy it to a remote branch and running it on a hosting space
2. Consume APIs that only accepts secure HTTPS connections (and complain when you try to whitelist /localhost/!)

Ngrok can be installed in all major operating systems as a standalone service. Its developer license is _free_ (with some restrictions like bandwidth and usage), but /it requires the creation of an account/.

To install it in MacOS we can use brew:

```bash
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

Instructions for different operating systems can be found [in the docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started).

## But how does it work?

When using ngrok, we can expose a web server on our machine, for example, a Node.js application running on /localhost:8000/ to the outer world by starting ngrok. The service will create a tunnel between our machine and the internet using a /random URL/ that we can share with other people.

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

## Some of its options and features features

### Automated SSL/TLS certificates

Ngrok supports HTTPS out of the box, and we have a couple of ways to set this up.
The easiest way is to specify it as a complete address:

```bash
ngrok http https://localhost:8000
```

Another way to do that is by connecting ngrok on port 443. It will assume by default that we want to use the HTTPS protocol:

```bash
ngrok http 443
```

### Custom domains

Custom domains are a paid feature, however, custom subdomains can be configured easily and work with the free plan.

```bash
ngrok http --subdomain=antopiras 80
```

### Authentication

Ngrok also supports basic authentication (specify user and password when setting it up), OAuth 2.0 (Google/GitHub account), and other forms of authentication.
We can add authentication with:

```bash
ngrok http --basic-auth="username:password" 8080
```

Or

```bash
ngrok http 8000 --oauth google
```

## Use it in your Node.js application

If we donâ€™t want to have to set up and manually start ngrok every time we come back to our laptop or we are looking for a more automated solution, we can use [this Node.js wrapper](https://github.com/bubenshchykov/ngrok).

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const ngrok = require('ngrok')

const app = express()
const port = 8000
const NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN = â€˜NGROK_AUTH_TOKENâ€™

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, async () => {
  await ngrok.authtoken(NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN)
  const url = await ngrok.connect(port)

  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
  console.log('ngrok tunnel url: ', url)
})
```

Once we have connected, we can retrieve the ngrok URL and use it inside our application.

## An alternative to ngrok

If you find ngrok too complex to use and want an easy and quick-to-use alternative for Node, check out [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/):

```bash
npm install -g localtunnel //use -g if you want to install it globally on your machine
```

Itâ€™s an NPM package and it is pretty similar to ngrok, but it doesnâ€™t require you to create an account. It also supports subdomains.

To use it in our simple application we just need to change a couple of lines:

```javascript
const localtunnel = require('localtunnel')

//â€¦

app.listen(port, async () => {
    const tunnel = await localtunnel({ port })

    console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
    console.log('localtunnel tunnel url: ', tunnel.url)
})
```

â€¦and thatâ€™s it! I hope you found this little guide useful. Leave a comment if you have more questions about this ðŸ˜„
