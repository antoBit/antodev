A while ago I was looking for a way to add a comment section to my static blog and this is the result of all the googling I did on the subject 💪🏻

## What’s on the menu

### Disqus

The first solution I looked into is [Disqus](https://blog.disqus.com/), but I soon decided not to use it simply because, while it’s a valid software with a huge community, it has some glaring flaws (at least for me):

-   the basic plan comes with ads

-   it tracks its users

-   if anonymous commenting is turned off, people need to create a Disqus account (more on that later)

-   it’s way too complex for my needs

### Jamstack Comments Engine

[Jamstack Comments Engine](https://jamstack-comments.netlify.app/) “… is an example of how a Jamstack site can implement comments.”

Ok, this is not exactly the first search result that comes up when googling “static blog comments”, but I ran into it and considered it simply because, from a developer point of view, it is a very smart approach.

The solution proposed here consists of a combination of [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) and its Submission API to trigger a new build of the web every time a comment is posted, after it’s approved by a moderator. It additionally explains how to create a Lambda function to get notified on Slack whenever a new comment comes in.

While I found this approach very interesting, I still have a day job and didn’t want to embark on the somewhat long, even though _very well documented_, process.

## utterances

After I gave up on the comments feature (no one reads my two-month-old blog anyway), I stumbled upon [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) and it blew my mind with its simplicity. It took me 10 minutes to add it to this blog, build time included.

### The perks

Straight from their page:

1. It’s [open source](https://github.com/utterance)

2. It doesn’t track users

3. No ads 👏🏻

4. All the comments data is stored in GitHub issues

5. It’s lightweight

### So, how does it work?

First of all, it uses GitHub issues to track comments, based on the post title: the first person to comment on a blog post will trigger the creation of a related issue and future comments on the same post will end up in that issue.

Smart, right? 🔮

The only requirements are that the repository connected to the app needs to be public and have the [utterances app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) installed on it.

Users will comment using their GitHub account, which is perfect for a tech/programming blog.

Oh, and it comes with 8 themes that will play well with most of the colour palette of the blogs out there!

## How to install it

Their page is pretty straightforward: just follow the configuration steps (repository name, optional label for the issues, chosen theme and even issue title format!) and you’re left with a script tag to add to your blog template:

```js
<script
    src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
    repo="antoBit/antodev"
    issue-term="title"
    label="💬"
    theme="dark-blue"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
    async
></script>
```

Note that the issue label supports emojis! 🎉

After that, just remember to install the _utterances app_ on the same repository you provided in the `repo` attribute and you’re done!
