## A journey in N parts (I don’t know yet)

In this post, I’ll go through the basic setup of how I built this blog using the awesome 11ty (and hopefully show why I fell in love with it so much!)

## Folder structure

The first thing I did was setting up the folder structure. I did not strive away from the recommended 11ty structure, except for the build directory (more on that later!):
