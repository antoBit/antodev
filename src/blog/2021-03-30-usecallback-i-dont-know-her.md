Spoiler alert: this is a rant that *might turn into something useful*. Maybe.

## I don‚Äôt know React

My React journey has been a constant learning experience, but there‚Äôs something about React that has been bugging me lately.

Ever since I changed company last year, I found myself in a new codebase, and with it came something I never saw before: an *odd quantity* of useCallback in every single component of the app.

I have to admit I was responsible for most of a medium/big react app at my previous company and it always ran smoothly even without this heavy optimization.
Of course, thanks to my beloved impostor syndrome I immediately thought ‚ÄúOh god, I‚Äôm a terrible developer, I don‚Äôt know React, I never use memoization‚Äù. You know, the usual.

## PR Review anxiety

Since I was not familiar with the concept of useCallback, useMemo (and loadash `memoize`!) I immediately documented myself, but all I could find were articles and tutorials about how to use these hooks and functions, and none of them touched deeply on the dependency array, which is something I constantly screw up!

Lately, I‚Äôve been reading a lot on the use of `useCallback` and `useMemo` in a React app (useful links at the end of the post ‚úèÔ∏è) because I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with my *fake it ‚Äòtill you make it* approach to this part of the framework and what I read was‚Ä¶ well, more confusing than ever.

## You shall not optimize (blindly)

<blockquote cite="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback">

**Performance optimizations are not free. They ALWAYS come with a cost but do NOT always come with a benefit to offset that cost.**

Therefore, *optimize responsibly*.

<span class="author">Kent C. Dodds</span>

</blockquote>

Pretty much every article I read said something along the lines of "it‚Äôs wrong to optimize before profiling the application and every optimization comes with a cost that can easily outweigh the benefit".

In all the articles and comments on Stack Overflow, I could find, pretty much everyone agreed that there are cases where it‚Äôs pretty clear that memoization help:

* Big, *very big* lists
* Passing down components to optimized children
* Referential equality checks in hooks dependencies
* Computationally expensive functions (we‚Äôre talking prime numbers calculations!)

I‚Äôll stop here, for now.
My goal is to keep digging into this argument and try to profile the application I maintain at work and come up with definitive data on which components actually benefit from memoization and which are actually slower thanks to it.

‚Ä¶stay tuned!

üìö As promised, I‚Äôll leave here the list of articles I read on the subject:
