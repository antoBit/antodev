It's time for me to come out: I've been working as a professional developer for 6 years and I've never managed to write a regex without intense googling and the help of [regex 101](https://regex101.com/).

This needs to stop, so I decided to do some googling, and as it turns out... regular expressions are not that complicated. At all.
