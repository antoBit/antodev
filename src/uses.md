Blatantly copied from [Wes Bos' /uses page](https://wesbos.com/uses){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, I decided to list what I use in my everyday life. I don't know, you may be curious?!? 😆

## Dev Life

### Shell configuration

I spend *a lot* of time on my terminal and I have to say I freaking love **[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**. I tried other terminals over the years, but I always come back to it.\
I have a bazillion plugins installed on it, but my favorites are:

* [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, seriously it's the best
* [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} (lets you `cd` into a previously visited directory, even if you misspell it!)
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} and [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}
* [emojiparty](https://gist.github.com/brennv/3e9a26308948f11d651f){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} (theme that prepends a random emoji to the command line 🥳)

### Main tools

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, because yes.
* **[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  An app for testing APIs, 'cause people who instantly remember the `curl` syntax and all its options have nothing to do with me.
* **[](https://brave.com/download/)[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/it_it/chrome/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  Obviously.
* **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/it/firefox/new/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  Firefox is my go-to browser of choice when I'm doing anything CSS related. Its developer tools are simply superior ([but don't listen to me, Kevin Powell knows this stuff better than I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-V8GFtwjos){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}).

## Productivity

* **[Bear App](https://bear.app/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  I could talk for hours about Bear. It's a markdown note-taking app, but it's more than that. I use it to write my work tasks every week, blog posts, plan holidays, jot down quick notes. It's perfectly fine on the free plan, but I can assure you: it's one of those apps where you actively *feel the need to pay for the paid plan* because they deserve it. \
  \
  I swear, I have an Android phone and I'm considering switching to iPhone just for their mobile app, I'm not kidding.
* **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**, it's fine. Slow as hell, but they're working on it, apparently.

## Messaging

* **[Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/it){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  It's a great email client, with a "smart" inbox, with the option to send delayed emails so you don't bother people outside of office hours
* **[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/it-it/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

## Utility

These are all the little pieces of software I couldn't like without. Seriously, Mac OS should have these built-in.

* **[Paste](https://pasteapp.io/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  Fast clipboard manager, I wouldn't be able to function without it.
* **[CleanShotX](https://cleanshot.com/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  Working 100% remotely I'm constantly taking screenshots and videos of my work to share on Slack and this app does it best.
* **[Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  A fantastic window manager for Mac OS.
* **[Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}**

  A fantastic emoji picker 🚀 💯

## Font

It's [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. It's great, free, and it supports ligatures 💅🏻
