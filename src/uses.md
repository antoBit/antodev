Blatantly copied from [Wes Bos' /uses page](https://wesbos.com/uses){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, I decided to list what I use in my everyday life. I don't know, you may be curious?!? üòÜ

## Dev Life

### Shell configuration

I spend *a lot* of time on my terminal and I have to say I freaking love iTerm2. I tried other terminals over the years, but I always come back to it.\
I have a bazillion plugins installed on it, but my favorites are:

* Oh-my-zsh, seriously it's the best
* autojump (lets you `cd` into a previously visited directory, even if you misspell it!)
* zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions
* emojiparty (theme that prepends a random emoji to the command line ü•≥)



### Main tools

* VS Code, because yes.
* Insomnia, an app for testing APIs, 'cause people who instantly remember the `curl` syntax and all its options have nothing to do with me.
* Brave, it's my browser of choice mainly because it's basically Chrome, but faster and with built-in privacy protection. Yes, it's made by a homophobe, I'm looking at alternatives, but it's hard to leave the Chrome ecosystem.



## Productivity

* Bear App

I could talk for hours about Bear. It's a markdown note-taking app, but it's more than that. I use it to write my work tasks every week, blog posts, plan holidays, jot down quick notes. It's perfectly fine on the free plan, but I can assure you: it's one of those apps where you actively *feel the need to pay for the paid plan* because they deserve it. \
\
I swear, I have an Android phone and I'm considering switching to iPhone just for their mobile app, I'm not kidding.

* Notion, it's fine. Slow as hell, but they're working on it, apparently.

## Messaging

* Spark
* Slack

## Utility

* Font Fira Code
* Paste
* CleanShotX
* Rocket
