Blatantly copied from [Wes Bos' /uses page](https://wesbos.com/uses), I decided to list what I use in my everyday life. I don't know, you may be curious?!? üòÜ

## Dev Life

### Shell configuration

I spend _a lot_ of time on my terminal and I have to say I freaking love **[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)**. I tried other terminals over the years, but I always come back to it.\
I have a bazillion plugins installed on it, but my favourites are:

-   [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), seriously it's the best
-   [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) (lets you `cd` into a previously visited directory, even if you misspell it!)
-   [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) and [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
-   [emojiparty](https://gist.github.com/brennv/3e9a26308948f11d651f) (a theme that prepends a random emoji to the command line ü•≥)

### Main tools

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), because yes.
-   **[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)**

    An app for testing APIs, 'cause people who instantly remember the `curl` syntax and all its options have nothing to do with me.

-   **[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/it_it/chrome/)**

    Obviously.

-   **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/it/firefox/new/)**

    Firefox is my go-to browser of choice when I'm doing anything CSS related. Its developer tools are simply superior ([but don't listen to me, Kevin Powell knows this stuff better than I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-V8GFtwjos)).

## Productivity

-   **[Bear App](https://bear.app/)**

    I could talk for hours about Bear. It's a markdown note-taking app, but it's more than that. I use it to write my work tasks every week, blog posts, plan holidays, jot down quick notes. It's perfectly fine on the free plan, but I can assure you: it's one of those apps where you actively _feel the need to pay for the paid plan_ because they deserve it. \
    \
    I swear, I have an Android phone and I'm considering switching to iPhone just for their mobile app, I'm not kidding.

-   **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)**, it's the best when it comes to organising large documents into categories and it has many layouts and templates to choose from.

## Messaging

-   **[Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/it)**

    It's a great email client, with a "smart" inbox, with the option to send delayed emails so you don't bother people outside of office hours

-   **[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/it-it/)**

## Utility

These are all the little pieces of software I couldn't like without. Seriously, Mac OS should have these built-in.

-   **[Paste](https://pasteapp.io/)**

    Fast clipboard manager, I wouldn't be able to function without it.

-   **[CleanShotX](https://cleanshot.com/)**

    Working 100% remotely I'm constantly taking screenshots and videos of my work to share on Slack and this app does it best.

-   **[Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/)**

    A fantastic window manager for Mac OS.

-   **[Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)**

    A fantastic emoji picker üöÄ üíØ

## Font

It's [Dank Mono](https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono). It's not cheap (a personal license goes for 24¬£), but it's freaking _beautiful_, especially on retina displays.
