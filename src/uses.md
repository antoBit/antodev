Blatantly copied from [Wes Bos' /uses page](https://wesbos.com/uses){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, I decided to list what I use in my everyday life. I don't know, you may be curious?!? 😆

## Dev Life

### Shell configuration

I spend *a lot* of time on my terminal and I have to say I freaking love **iTerm2**. I tried other terminals over the years, but I always come back to it.\
I have a bazillion plugins installed on it, but my favorites are:

* Oh-my-zsh, seriously it's the best
* autojump (lets you `cd` into a previously visited directory, even if you misspell it!)
* zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions
* emojiparty (theme that prepends a random emoji to the command line 🥳)

### Main tools

* VS Code, because yes.
* **Insomnia**

  An app for testing APIs, 'cause people who instantly remember the `curl` syntax and all its options have nothing to do with me.
* **Brave**

  It's my browser of choice mainly because it's basically Chrome, but faster and with built-in privacy protection. Yes, [it's made by a homophobe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mozilla-ceo-resignation-idUSBREA321Y320140403){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, I'm looking at alternatives, but it's hard to leave the Chrome ecosystem.

## Productivity

* **Bear App**

  I could talk for hours about Bear. It's a markdown note-taking app, but it's more than that. I use it to write my work tasks every week, blog posts, plan holidays, jot down quick notes. It's perfectly fine on the free plan, but I can assure you: it's one of those apps where you actively *feel the need to pay for the paid plan* because they deserve it. \
  \
  I swear, I have an Android phone and I'm considering switching to iPhone just for their mobile app, I'm not kidding.
* **Notion**, it's fine. Slow as hell, but they're working on it, apparently.

## Messaging

* **Spark**

  It's a great email client, with a "smart" inbox, with the option to send delayed emails so you don't bother people outside of office hours
* **Slack**

## Utility

These are all the little pieces of software I couldn't like without. Seriously, Mac OS should have these built-in.

* **Paste**

  Fast clipboard manager, I wouldn't be able to function without it.
* **CleanShotX**

  Working 100% remotely I'm constantly taking screenshots and videos of my work to share on Slack and this app does it best.
* **Rocket**

  A fantastic emoji picker 🚀 💯

## Font

It's Fira Code. It's great, free, and has ligatures 💅🏻
